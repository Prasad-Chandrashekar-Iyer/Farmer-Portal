 <p>Private efforts in many areas do not prove to be sufficient to improve agricultural production. Good roads, storage facilities, power, information about the market, transportation to the ports, etc. are vital for carrying out production and sale operations.
  These facilities are in the domain of public goods, the costs of which are huge and whose benefits accrue to all the cultivators in an area.
  The government takes the responsibility of providing the public goods and given the condition of Indian farmers a lower price can be charged from the poorer farmers.</p>
