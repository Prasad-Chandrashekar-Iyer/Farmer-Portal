<p>The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), 1995 permitted the developed countries to continue to provide farm subsidies, but under certain restrictions. In WTO terminology, agricultural subsidies have been segregated into various ‘boxes’:<br>It includes amounts spent on research, disease control, and infrastructure and food security. These also include direct payments made to farmers such as income support that do not stimulate production. These are not considered trade distorting and are encouraged.<br><span class="usha2">India's Disputes At WTO :</span><br>
    Recently, Australia has referred India to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over subsidies paid to sugarcane farmers.<br>
    On November 12 US filed a complaint against India alleging that India has paid out far more in cotton subsidies than the WTO rules permit.<br>
    In May 2018, the US submitted a communication under provisions of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) on certain measures of India providing Market Price Support (MPS) to wheat and rice for the years 2010-11 to 2013-14.<br>India has maintained its stand that the country’s sugar exports comply with WTO rules.
